This is an **automatically** generated git version, based on the release into the [TYPO3 Extension Repository](http://www.typo3.org/extensions/).
You can find the original version at http://typo3.org/extensions/repository/view/powermail/ .

Every version of the extension is tagged with the version number, therefore you can switch quite easily between different versions.
